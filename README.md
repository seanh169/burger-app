# Burger Ordering Application

<p>This is a very simple single page burger ordering application. This was my way of learning an amazing new framework, React, while creating something fun while following a tutorial by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. This project includes a google firebase (database) via the RESTFUL API for authentication and persistant storage. I tried to implement as many React features as possible while maintiaing some of the industry best practices for modularization. Some of the features include : </p>

<ul>
<li>Accessing a server through restful api(axios is the library)</li>
<li>Navigation using React router</li>
<li>Forms and Form Validations</li>
<li>Best practices for Redux State Management using actions and reducers. </li>
<li>Authentication and user authentication state management using JSON web tokens </li>
<li>Utility methods to avoid mutations</li>
<li>Unit testing using the jest and enzyme libraries</li>
</ul>

## This project is current live at : https://react-my-burger-c0f8f.firebaseapp.com/
