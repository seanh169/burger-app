# Burger Ordering Application

<p>This is a very simple single page burger ordering application. This was my way of learning React while creating something fun. This was completed following a step-by-step tutorial by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. This project includes a google firebase (database) via the RESTFUL API for authentication and persistant storage. I tried to implement as many React features as possible while maintiaing some of the industry best practices for modularization/component structure. Some of the included features include : </p>

<ul>
<li>Accessing a server through restful api(axios is the library)</li>
<li>Navigation using React router</li>
<li>Forms and Form Validations</li>
<li>Best practices for Redux State Management using actions and reducers. </li>
<li>Authentication and user authentication state management using JSON web tokens </li>
<li>Utility methods to avoid mutations</li>
<li>Unit testing using the jest and enzyme libraries</li>
<li>Lazy loading for performance improvements</li>
</ul>
